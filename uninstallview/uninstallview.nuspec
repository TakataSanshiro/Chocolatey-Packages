    <summary>UninstallView is a tool for Windows that collects information about all programs installed on your system and displays the details of the installed programs in one table.
    </summary>
    <description>
You can use it to get installed programs information for your local system, for remote computer on your network, and for external hard-drive plugged to your computer. It also allows you to easily uninstall a software on your local computer and remote computer (Including quiet uninstall if the installer supports it). 
MyUninstaller vs UninstallView
MyUninstaller is a very old tool originally developed in 2003 and it's now considered as outdated. UninstallView replaces the old MyUninstaller tool. 
System Requirements
This tool works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows XP and up to Windows 10. Both 32-bit and 64-bit systems are supported.
